<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an increased demand for pet-related services. When their owners leave to work, many dogs have no options but to spend the entire day at home. Meanwhile, many students would appreciate the companionship of a dog. Puppy Hangout is a marketplace where you can connect with reliable and affordable dog sitters in your neighbourhood. </p>
<p>Are you worried about your pet staying home alone? Nowadays, dogs are like our babies. We understand that you don’t want to send your babies to an untrained stranger. So come chat with our trusted pet lovers.</p>
<p>We built an MVP and did extensive competitor research on other dog sitting products. We acknowledge that safety is the major concern. We provide the owners with reliable, interviewed, trained dog sitters. We collaborate with vet schools. A vet student needs 400 hours of working with animals to acquire the full licence. We provide volunteer proof for vet students.</p>
<p>We are working on a feature that directs the dog owner and sitter to a video call. We acknowledge that pet owners need their pets to be seated in a specific hourly time and we are working on a feature that allows filtering of time and location.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading! We hope you support Puppy Hangout’s expansion.</p>
